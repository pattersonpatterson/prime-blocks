############### Getting data and arranging in Data.Frame
# Take in value and check that it's not such a huge number


# Find prime factorization of number and store factors (not 1) in Data.Frame


# Randomly generate int(x,y) positions for each factor (bound to 10, maybe 7)
# Positions must be unique in either x or y


# Generate width for each factor as a multiple of factor in a logarithmic scale
# All heights = 0.9


# Assign specific colors to each prime factor


############### Display 
# Insert data into ColumnDataSource


# hold() to put all the boxes on one grid

# Make a rect glyph for each factor


# Add text to display the number for each box


# turn off grid lines - bk.grid().grid_line_color = None

# show the chart
